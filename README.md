## Configure Slack

Before you can start integrating the gem, you need to first add a webhook to which the bot wil ping and then send out the message, so let's do that:

1. Open [https://api.slack.com/](https://api.slack.com/) and sign in if you haven't
2. Go to the [Integrations](https://icalialabs.slack.com/services/new) section
3. Then look for the [Incoming WebHooks](https://icalialabs.slack.com/services/new/incoming-webhook) integration
4. Select the channel you wish to hook the service
5. You'll be redirected to a page with some steps to test the webhook, just take note of the token on the left.

You are now ready to go!


## Installation & Usage

You can install and use Tarumi as a stand-alone library, to install it just run:

```console
$ gem install tarumi
```

If you are using Rails, just add it to your Gemfile:

```ruby
gem "tarumi"
```

And then run the `bundle` command to install it:

```console
$ bundle
```

A simple example on how to use it is presented below:

```ruby
require 'tarumi'

slackBot = Tarumi::Bot.new("yourteam", "yourtoken", hash_of_options)
slackBot.ping "A text to post"
```

The example above will post a message to the `#general` channel, but you can easily customize it with the hash of options when initializing the bot:

```ruby
options = {
	username: "usernametopost",
	channel: "#anotherchannel",
	hook_name: "webhookname"
}
```
That should be it for you to easily configure the bot and start sending messages.
